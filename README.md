# Customer Segments Project

Goal is to analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories. The dataset is composed of six important product categories: 'Channel', 'Region', 'Fresh', 'Milk', 'Grocery', 'Frozen', 'Detergents_Paper', and 'Delicatessen'. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.


## How to read the files in this project?

Any steps to a model is to understand data, please refer to 'customers.csv' and use this [UCI link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) to learn more about the data and its attributes. 

Next, you could reference customer_segments.ipny to understand the actions I took from downloading, understanding, and partioning the data for the model to developing, training, and validating the classification model to testing on a sample of data to evaluate model performance. 

Technically, you need certain python libraries such as [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), visuals.py (provided), [matplotlib](), [sklearn / scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

Need a software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

For main sauce of files click on this [Udacity ML GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/customer_segments)

## **Why does this all matter?**

This project provides hands-on experience with:
> How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
> How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
> How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
> How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
>How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.

## What is this visuals.py file?

Your guess was as best as mine when I started this project so I won't share the secret just yet. No really, this was a supplementary file with the project. Peak inside customer_segments.ipny as to why this matters and here is the hint it imports supplementary visualizations. Please do not modify.

## FAQ

**What if customer_segments.ipny is not loading?**
> Try downloading the file and running on Jupyter Notebook.
